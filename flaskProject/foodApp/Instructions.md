# Progress

# 3/27/2021:
# Successfully implemented search, add, and delete restaurant in the "restaurant" table in the database HungryGators-19.

# Currently working on adding entries to the "menu" table without too much hardcoding in database. Then planning on to work on deleting entries from the menu table, then finally try to search by entry items in the search bar for searching restaurants.

# Then planning on working on calculating entry totals if a customer wants to order entries from a certain restaurant and assign it to a delivery driver.

# To connect from backend to database, use:
# app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = mysql://username:password@server/db
# where username is the username to your database, password is the password to your database, server is the server of your database, and db = HungryGators-19
